# Sleep_cycle_alarm
An smart alarm clock which will wake up the user at the right time based on the sleep cycle.
The app calculates the right time to go for sleep based on the aimed time of wake up.
Exemple: user wants to wake up at 7:00. The app will return him the time when he should go for sleep = 23:16 (5 complete cycles of sleep + 14 minutes to fall asleep in reverse).
It also calculates the right moment to wake up based on the moment of fall asleep. 
Example: user knows he wants to go in bed at 22:30. The app will return him the time of waking up = 6:14 (5 complete cycles of sleep + 14 minutes to fall asleep added to the initial time given by the user).
