# Sleep_cycle_alarm
### A smart alarm clock which will wake up the user at the right time based on the sleep cycles.<br>
The app calculates the right time to go for sleep based on the aimed time of wake up.<br>
<b>Exemple</b>: user wants to wake up at 7:30. The app will return him the time when he should go for sleep = 23:46 (5 complete cycles of sleep + 14 minutes to fall asleep in reverse).<br>
It also calculates the right moment to wake up based on the moment of fall asleep.<br>
<b>Example</b>: user knows he wants to go in bed at 22:30. The app will return him the time of waking up = 6:14 (5 complete cycles of sleep + 14 minutes to fall asleep added to the initial time given by the user).
